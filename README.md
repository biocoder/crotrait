## Introduction

This is the homepage of **CroTrait**, a software package that performs efficient inference of species, O serotypes and sequence types (STs) of *Cronobacter*. **CroTrait** was created by *Lu Wang*. **CroTrait** is called from a directory containing one or multiple genome sequences and each genome sequence should be saved to a separate file in FASTA format. Input files can either be complete genomes or draft genomes. It is able to analyze hundreds of genomes data in a matter of hours on a ordinary PC. <br><br>
Moreover, post data analysis and visualization module embedded in **CroTrait** further assist the user in checking and analyzing the data.

## Environment set up
**CroTrait** is a program written in python and the external software **BLAST+** and **MEGA** need to be installed and configured locally:<br>

>**[MEGA](https://www.megasoftware.net/)** (version X (64-bit))<br>

>**[BLAST+](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)** (version 2.9.0)<br>

>**[python](https://www.python.org/)** (version 3.8.0) <br>
